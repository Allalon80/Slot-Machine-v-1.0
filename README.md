# Slot-Machine-v-1.0
This is my first and rudimental version of one slot machine with pixi.js framework

Technology used:
HTML 5
Javascript
jQuery 
CSS

I also used a java library found online for slot machines, namely "slot.js"
I also tried to integrate the libraries of the pixi.js framework but with little success (I had never seen this framework before)


#How to use

it's very simple just press the GREEN BUTTON "SPIN" and hopes to be lucky ^^ also you can set the amount of the coin so as to risk more but also increase the winnings.
